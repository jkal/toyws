Note: This is a _really_ old project I found in old archives from when I was
trying to learn about web servers and C and Unix. I don't know if it compiles
or if it works. I'm putting it here for historical purposes.

Single-threaded toy web server using libev, libeio and ry's http-parser.

Run `premake` to generate a Makefile and `make` to compile.
